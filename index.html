    <h1>Hell Let Loose - Squad Types and classes</h1>
    <p>Hell Let Loose is a tactical First Person Shooter based in WW2, currently having three factions, US, Germany, and the Soviet Union. (as of October 2022) It requires you to communicate with your team mates and coordinate attacks together in order to win a game. These are all of the classes currently available in the game</p>
    <h2>Commander Role</h2>
    <p>Arguably one of the most important roles in the game, The Commanders job is to lead the team to victory. They can communicate directly to Squad Leaders to tell them what they need to do and where they need to be. On top of this, the commander has special access to abilities and vehicle spawning. The commander can spawn in tanks and trucks for the tank crew to use, as well as order Bombing Runs, Recon planes, Supply Drops, Airheads, and tons of other things to help out their team.</p>

    <h2>Infantry Squad Classes</h2>
    
    <h3>Officer</h3>
    <p>Without an Officer, an infantry squad is pretty much useless. The Officers Job is to communicate with the commander to receive orders from the commander and then lead their squad do complete the orders. Officers have a watch that allows them to place Outposts, which are spawn points for just their squad, and don't require any supplies. They can also place Garrisons with the watch, which are spawn points for the entire team, but they require 50 supplies in friendly territory and 100 supplies in enemy territory. Infantry Squad Outposts and Garrisons can only be placed in friendly territory or two squares in to enemy territory. The number of loadouts vary between faction, but each one will give some different weapons once unlocked.</p>
    
    <h3>Rifleman</h3>
    <p>The basic recruit. Equipped with a rifle, some grenades, and an ammo box, (for the starting loadout) the rifleman's job is to follow their officers orders and help the squad. There is no limit to how many rifleman can be in each squad, but the squads player limit is capped at six players. Although, all of the other roles are useful in their own ways and should definitely be active in a squad. This role is great for new players, and can always be used as a backup in case you can't get the role you originally wanted.</p>

    <h3>Assault</h3>
    <p>Equipped with varied weapons and plenty of grenades and smokes, the Assault class's job is to get in, clear the enemies, and allow their squad to make it to where they need to be. This is one of my favorite classes within the whole game.</p>

    <h3>Automatic Rifleman</h3>
    <p>Similar to the rifleman, the Automatic Rifleman is a great class for both new and experienced players. Without a specific job to be doing, it is great for players to be able to get in the game and into combat. It is also a crucial role to have, as the Automatic Rifleman provides wonderful firepower for the squad. </p>

    <h3>Medic</h3>
    <p>The medic is equipped with plenty of tools to revive downed teammates, as well as a basic gun, without much ammo. The medic works best behind the frontline, sneaking around and healing players. Be warned though, many players think that giving up immediately is the best route to go, and will give up even when your just twenty meters away from them. But if you can find a squad that actually knows what they are doing and lets you revive them, you are going to be a massive help to your team.</p>

    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>Support, Supply Switch role can be a common thing to see whenever a garrison needs to go up. The support role is equipped with varied guns, and a set of 50 supplies, as well as munition, explosive, and medical supplies with some loadouts. The Support role is dedicated to placing supplies down where they need to be so that Officers can get garrisons or other defenses up. Sometimes, one support player will place their supplies, and then temporarily switch to a different class, allowing another squad member to go support and place down the remaining supplies so the officer can place the garrison, and then switch back to their original role. This method is much faster than waiting for one players supply drop cool down to end. </p>

    <h3>Machine Gunner</h3>
    <p>Set it up, take them down. The machine gunner is equipped with different types of machine guns depending on their loadout. Most of the MG's can only be aimed down the sights when their bi-pod is deployed on an object, otherwise, they must hip-fire. The MG does best when they have deployed their bi-pod at a safe distance in an area where they can see the enemies. With all of the ammo that they have, they do a great job of suppressing the enemy, forcing them to stay behind cover while the rest of the team moves up to take them out. This class also goes great with a player that has an ammo box, that way extra ammo can be provided.</p>

    <h3>Anti-tank</h3>
    <p>Tanks are one of the most devastating thing that can happen to an infantry squad, taking them out in a matter of seconds. The Anti-tank's job is to prevent that. Equipped with a basic gun as well as their factions respective anti-tank weapons, the anti-tank must sneak around behind the tank in order to get a clear line of sight to its engine, and launch the rocket at it to try to take it out. Not all tanks can be destroyed with the amount of rockets the player has, so a refill from a support player may be necessary.</p>

    <h3>Engineer</h3>
    <p>The engineer's job is to fortify positions and set up defenses and resource nodes. There are three types of resource nodes, Manpower, Munitions, and Fuel. Each node placed will generate these resources, which are what the commander needs in order to use the special abilities. Along with that, the engineer can build a variety of defenses, such as bunkers or barbed wire. These can be very useful for defending a control point, by blocking off any entrances with them. The engineer is equipped with a basic gun and some ammo. On top of this, with later loadouts the engineer has a satchel charge which can be set on enemy defenses to destroy them, as well as on tanks to destroy them.</p>
