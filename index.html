    <h1>Hell Let Loose - Squad Types and classes</h1>
    <p>Hell Let Loose is a tactical First Person Shooter based in WW2, currently having three factions, US, Germany, and the Soviet Union. (as of October 2022) It requires you to communicate with your team mates and coordinate attacks together in order to win a game. These are all of the classes currently available in the game</p>
    <h2>Commander Role</h2>
    <p>Arguably one of the most important roles in the game, The Commanders job is to lead the team to victory. They can communicate directly to Squad Leaders to tell them what they need to do and where they need to be. On top of this, the commander has special access to abilities and vehicle spawning. The commander can spawn in tanks and trucks for the tank crew to use, as well as order Bombing Runs, Recon planes, Supply Drops, Airheads, and tons of other things to help out their team.</p>

    <h2>Infantry Squad Classes</h2>
    
    <h3>Officer</h3>
    <p>Without an Officer, an infantry squad is pretty much useless. The Officers Job is to communicate with the commander to receive orders from the commander and then lead their squad do complete the orders. Officers have a watch that allows them to place Outposts, which are spawn points for just their squad, and don't require any supplies. They can also place Garrisons with the watch, which are spawn points for the entire team, but they require 50 supplies in friendly territory and 100 supplies in enemy territory. Infantry Squad Outposts and Garrisons can only be placed in friendly territory or two squares in to enemy territory. The number of loadouts vary between faction, but each one will give some different weapons once unlocked.</p>
    
    <h3>Rifleman</h3>
    <p>The basic recruit. Equipped with a rifle, some grenades, and an ammo box, (for the starting loadout) the rifleman's job is to follow their officers orders and help the squad. There is no limit to how many rifleman can be in each squad, but the squads player limit is capped at six players. Although, all of the other roles are useful in their own ways and should definitely be active in a squad. This role is great for new players, and can always be used as a backup in case you can't get the role you originally wanted.</p>

    <h3>Assault</h3>
    <p>Equipped with varied weapons and plenty of grenades and smokes, the Assault class's job is to get in, clear the enemies, and allow their squad to make it to where they need to be.</p>
